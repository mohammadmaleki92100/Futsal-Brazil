Screening of error performance of 10 Brazilian professional futsal players across matches 

This is a small and practical dataset designed for step-by-step training in analyzing the factors influencing goal scoring and player errors in futsal, using data science and performance data. The project reflects the approach adopted by the Portugal national futsal team in addressing this issue. This method helps predict how stress levels impact players' performance (such as performance errors). It also demonstrates how to identify the most important and influential indicators affecting playersâ€™ motor performance.
